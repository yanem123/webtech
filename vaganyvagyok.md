# Harry Potter books I guess

**Harry Potter** is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author [J. K. Rowling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling). The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends *Hermione Granger* and *Ron Weasley*, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's conflict with Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic, and subjugate all wizards and Muggles[^1].

The series was originally published in English by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States. A series of many genres, including fantasy, drama, coming-of-age fiction, and the British school story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror, and romance), the world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references.[1] Major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, madness, and death.

## Hogwarts Express

The Hogwarts Express is a train that carries pupils non-stop from Platform 9+3⁄4 at King's Cross station in London to Hogsmeade Station, near Hogwarts. Prefects of the school ride in a separate carriage near the front of the train. The compartments on the train appear to be lettered; in Half-Blood Prince, the "Slug Club" meets in compartment C.

The train began use in the 1850s. Before that, pupils used to reach Hogwarts on brooms or enchanted carriages.
